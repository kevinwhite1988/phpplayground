Starting to build a lightweight MVC timeclock application.

Started writing this on 5/14/2013 to show a little php code.

Going to start creating objects based off of the database tomorrow.
Want to add Htmlhelpers to models tomorrow (easy)

Will update SQL Query with timesheet table and will include an insert of Admin into the program.

Admin is NOT an employee in the system, just a user.

I know I have some Php on my network somewhere, I also know there may be a user authentication class out there, hopefully I can find it and implement it here.

Nope, no Php on my network.

Made some minor updates today. Added php helpers to the project. Just realized I never added an .htaccess will do that really quick.
